# NeoCMS

## Version 2.0

Version 2.0 is a complete rewrite to ensure we support the latest jQuery and TinyMCE GPL version.

To install:

* Drop in the CMS folder into a static website
* Drop in the uploads folder into the static website
* Edit credentials in /cms/init.php for any users that are required
* Update editable divs to contain the class 'editable'
* It _should_ then just work by visiting /cms/ and logging in

## Requirements

* PHP 8 on Linux. None of that Windows Server crap

## Known Bugs

* File (not images) uploads need to be implemented
* Not completely tested

If any issues arise, raise it as a bug in the issues page on GitHub
